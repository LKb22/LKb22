## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luke, a fresh career changer and bootcamer, Junior Fullstack Developer and Senior Talent Success Advisor, and Master's Graduate and researcher. I recently graduated from Le Wagonâ€™s intensive 9-week Web Development Bootcamp and built a website on Ruby connecting junior and senior developers looking for live mock interviews. I'm eager to bring together new and seasoned skills for my next challenge in tech.
